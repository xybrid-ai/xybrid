title: xybrid run
description: Execute a hybrid pipeline
---

Execute a hybrid pipeline on the current device.

## Usage

```bash
xybrid run --config <path>
xybrid run --pipeline <name>
xybrid run --pipeline <name> --dry-run
```

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--config` | `-c` | Load a pipeline YAML file directly |
| `--pipeline` | `-p` | Look up `<name>.yml` under `examples/` |
| `--dry-run` | | Simulate routing without execution |
| `--policy` | | Load an additional policy bundle |

## Behavior

1. Parses YAML into `PipelineConfig`
2. Runs policy → routing → execution loop
3. Prints stage latency and routing summaries

In dry-run mode, the CLI prints routing decisions and simulated outputs without invoking adapters.

## Examples

### Run from config file

```bash
xybrid run --config ./pipelines/voice-assistant.yaml
```

### Run named pipeline

```bash
xybrid run --pipeline hiiipe
```

Looks for `hiiipe.yml` or `hiiipe.yaml` in:
- `xybrid-cli/examples/`
- `./examples/`

### Dry run (simulate only)

```bash
xybrid run --pipeline hiiipe --dry-run
```

Output shows routing decisions without actual execution:

```
▶️ Stage: whisper-tiny@1.2 → would route to: local
▶️ Stage: gpt-4o-mini → would route to: integration
▶️ Stage: kokoro-82m@0.1 → would route to: local
```

### With custom policy

```bash
xybrid run --pipeline hiiipe --policy ./policies/strict-privacy.yaml
```

## Sample Output

```
▶️ Stage: whisper-tiny@1.2 → local
🎯 Routing: local (fast path)
⚙️ Execution complete (52ms)

▶️ Stage: gpt-4o-mini → integration
🎯 Routing: integration (OpenAI)
⚙️ Execution complete (340ms)

▶️ Stage: kokoro-82m@0.1 → local
🎯 Routing: local (fast path)
⚙️ Execution complete (89ms)

🎉 Pipeline complete (total 481ms)
```

## Pipeline Format

The `run` command expects YAML pipelines:

```yaml
name: "voice-assistant"
stages:
  - whisper-tiny@1.0
  - target: integration
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o-mini
  - kokoro-82m@0.1
```
