description: Native iOS SDK for on-device ML inference
---

The iOS SDK provides native Swift bindings to the Xybrid runtime for iOS and macOS applications.

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon** - The iOS SDK is currently in development. In the meantime, you can use the [Flutter SDK](/docs/integrations/sdks/flutter) for cross-platform iOS development.
</Callout>

## Planned Features

- Native Swift API
- SwiftUI integration
- CoreML acceleration
- Metal GPU support
- Neural Engine (ANE) optimization

## Expected API

Based on the Flutter SDK patterns, the iOS SDK will follow a similar structure:

```swift
import Xybrid

// Initialize
try await Xybrid.initialize()

// Load model from registry
let model = try await Xybrid.model(
    modelId: "whisper-tiny-candle",
    version: "1.0",
    registry: "https://registry.xybrid.dev"
).load()

// Run inference
let envelope = Envelope.audio(data: audioData)
let result = try await model.run(envelope: envelope)
print("Transcription: \(result.text)")

// Cleanup
model.unload()
```

## Pipeline Example

```swift
let pipeline = try await Xybrid.pipeline(yaml: """
name: voice-assistant
stages:
  - whisper-tiny-candle@1.0
  - target: integration
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o-mini
  - kokoro-82m@0.1
""").load()

let result = try await pipeline.run(
    envelope: .audio(data: audioData)
)

// Play TTS response
let audioOutput = result.audio
```
