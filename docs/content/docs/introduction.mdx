description: On-device AI SDK for mobile, desktop, and edge
---

Xybrid is an **on-device AI SDK** that lets you run ML models directly in your mobile and desktop apps. Add speech-to-text, text-to-speech, LLMs, vision, and embeddings — all running locally on the user's device with no cloud dependency.

## What You Can Build

- **Speech-to-text** — transcribe audio on-device with Whisper
- **Text-to-speech** — generate natural-sounding speech with Kokoro
- **LLMs** — run language models locally for chat, summarization, and more
- **Vision** — classify images and detect objects on-device
- **Embeddings** — generate vector embeddings for search and similarity

Chain these capabilities into multi-step pipelines that run entirely on-device, or selectively route to cloud APIs when you need more power.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Available SDKs |
|----------|---------------|
| iOS | Flutter, Swift (early access) |
| Android | Flutter, Kotlin (early access) |
| macOS | Flutter, Swift (early access), Unity |
| Linux | Flutter |
| Windows | Flutter (planned) |
