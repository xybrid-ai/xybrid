# zzz-sys

[natives-manifest.json](natives-manifest.json) pins the zzz CPU binaries for
Kitten TTS 2, including release versions, archive checksums, ABI requirements,
and linker metadata.

| Binary target | Compiled baseline |
| --- | --- |
| macOS ARM64 | macOS 13+ |
| Android ARM64 | Android API 29+ |
| Linux x86_64 | x86-64-v3 CPU, glibc 2.28+ |

Privately stage a pinned slice before native builds with
`python3 tools/scripts/zzz_pull.py --target <target>` from the repository root;
see `--help` for authentication, offline archives and staged verification.
The tool prints the verified slice path for `XYBRID_ZZZ_PREBUILT_DIR`. Keep its
archives, receipts and staging directories private.

Rust bindings and native linking will be added during integration. Model
weights are supplied separately.
