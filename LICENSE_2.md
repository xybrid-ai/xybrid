## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use Xybrid in my startup?
Yes, if your startup has less than $10M in total funding, less than $5M in
annual revenue, AND fewer than 50 employees. Once you exceed any threshold,
you need a commercial license.

### Can I use Xybrid for my personal AI projects?
Yes, completely free for personal and hobby use.

### Can I self-host Xybrid for my company's internal use?
Yes, if you meet the criteria in Section 2. Internal use is permitted.

### Can I build a product that uses Xybrid internally?
Yes, if you meet the criteria in Section 2 AND you're not offering Xybrid
itself as a service. Using Xybrid as internal infrastructure for your own
product is permitted.

### Can I offer "Xybrid hosting" or "Managed Xybrid" to customers?
No. This requires a commercial license regardless of your company size.

### Can I fork Xybrid and offer it as my own service?

### What if we're a larger company but want to evaluate Xybrid?
Contact licensing@xybrid.io for an evaluation license.

### Can cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) use this?
Only with a commercial license. The hosted service restriction in Section 3
explicitly covers this use case.

### What happens if we grow past the thresholds?
You have 60 days to obtain a commercial license. We recommend reaching out
proactively as you approach the thresholds.

### Can I contribute to Xybrid?
Yes! Contributions are welcome. By contributing, you agree to the terms in
Section 6, which includes granting Xybrid the right to relicense your
contributions.
